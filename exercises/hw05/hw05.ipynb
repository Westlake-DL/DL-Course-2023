    "### Limitations of Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, linearity implies the *weaker* assumption of *monotonicity*, i.e.,\n",
    "that any increase in our feature must\n",
    "either always cause an increase in our model's output\n",
    "(if the corresponding weight is positive),\n",
    "or always cause a decrease in our model's output\n",
    "(if the corresponding weight is negative).\n",
    "Sometimes that makes sense.\n",
    "For example, if we were trying to predict\n",
    "whether an individual will repay a loan,\n",
    "we might reasonably assume that all other things being equal,\n",
    "an applicant with a higher income\n",
    "would always be more likely to repay\n",
    "than one with a lower income.\n",
    "While monotonic, this relationship likely\n",
    "is not linearly associated with the probability of\n",
    "repayment. An increase in income from \\$0 to \\$50,000\n",
    "likely corresponds to a bigger increase\n",
    "in likelihood of repayment\n",
    "than an increase from \\$1 million to \\$1.05 million.\n",
    "One way to handle this might be to post-process our outcome\n",
    "such that linearity becomes more plausible,\n",
    "by using the logistic map (and thus the logarithm of the probability of outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can easily come up with examples\n",
    "that violate monotonicity.\n",
    "Say for example that we want to predict health as a function\n",
    "of body temperature.\n",
    "For individuals with a body temperature\n",
    "above 37°C (98.6°F),\n",
    "higher temperatures indicate greater risk.\n",
    "However, for individuals with body temperatures\n",
    "below 37°C, lower temperatures indicate greater risk!\n",
    "Again, we might resolve the problem\n",
    "with some clever preprocessing, such as using the distance from 37°C\n",
    "as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about classifying images of cats and dogs?\n",
    "Should increasing the intensity\n",
    "of the pixel at location (13, 17)\n",
    "always increase (or always decrease)\n",
    "the likelihood that the image depicts a dog?\n",
    "Reliance on a linear model corresponds to the implicit\n",
    "assumption that the only requirement\n",
    "for differentiating cats vs. dogs is to assess\n",
    "the brightness of individual pixels.\n",
    "This approach is doomed to fail in a world\n",
    "where inverting an image preserves the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet despite the apparent absurdity of linearity here,\n",
    "as compared with our previous examples,\n",
    "it is less obvious that we could address the problem\n",
    "with a simple preprocessing fix.\n",
    "That is, because the significance of any pixel\n",
    "depends in complex ways on its context\n",
    "(the values of the surrounding pixels).\n",
    "While there might exist a representation of our data\n",
    "that would take into account\n",
    "the relevant interactions among our features,\n",
    "on top of which a linear model would be suitable,\n",
    "we simply do not know how to calculate it by hand.\n",
    "With deep neural networks, we used observational data\n",
    "to jointly learn both a representation via hidden layers\n",
    "and a linear predictor that acts upon that representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can overcome the limitations of linear models\n",
    "by incorporating one or more hidden layers.\n",
    "The easiest way to do this is to stack\n",
    "many fully connected layers on top of each other.\n",
    "Each layer feeds into the layer above it,\n",
    "until we generate outputs.\n",
    "We can think of the first $L-1$ layers\n",
    "as our representation and the final layer\n",
    "as our linear predictor.\n",
    "This architecture is commonly called\n",
    "a *multilayer perceptron*,\n",
    "often abbreviated as *MLP*, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An MLP with a hidden layer of 5 hidden units. ](./imgs/mlp.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This MLP has 4 inputs, 3 outputs,\n",
    "and its hidden layer contains 5 hidden units.\n",
    "Since the input layer does not involve any calculations,\n",
    "producing outputs with this network\n",
    "requires implementing the computations\n",
    "for both the hidden and output layers;\n",
    "thus, the number of layers in this MLP is 2.\n",
    "Note that both layers are fully connected.\n",
    "Every input influences every neuron in the hidden layer,\n",
